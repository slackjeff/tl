# tl

![Shellcheck](https://img.shields.io/badge/shellcheck-OK-brightgreen)

## DESC
This is a small script that follows UNIX laws. Do one thing and do it well.
A simple text plain file is created in your $HOME/.todo.txt
And is manipulated with some tools like grep/sed, tl written in Shell Posix.

## Why?
I was tired of using more "complex" software like todo.txt. I wanted something very simple, that followed the KISS and UNIX philosophy. Written in 50 lines, removing comments and blank lines.

## USE
Add ***tl*** script to /usr/bin/tl and give execute permission, ***chmod +x tl***.
You can add a new task with ***add***, list with ***@*** and end the task with ***end***
